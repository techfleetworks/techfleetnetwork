 * AUTH-OAUTH-APEX-EDGE-301-001
 *
 * Root-cause contract: the apex `techfleet.network` MUST respond with a
 * 301 to `https://www.techfleet.network/<same path>` at the EDGE (Lovable
 * hosting / Cloudflare), NOT via client JS. This is the test that proves
 * the real fix landed and unlocks deletion of the `enforceCanonicalHost()`
 * boot stopgap in `src/lib/host-canonical.ts`.
 *
 * Red until a human flips `www.techfleet.network` to Primary in Lovable
 * Project Settings → Domains. Green after.
 *
 * Skipped unless TFN_EDGE_CONTRACT=1 (this hits the production origin and
 * must not run against ephemeral preview hosts).
