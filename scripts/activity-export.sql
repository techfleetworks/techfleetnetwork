-- activity-export.sql
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Repeatable export + pattern-analysis queries for the platform activity log.
--
-- Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (new project: pzvqxdgoztbfikfuifix), then use
-- the "Download CSV" button on the results pane to export each result set.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
--   The admin Activity Log page (src/pages/ActivityLogPage.tsx) reads a single
--   table: public.audit_log. Its in-app "Download CSV" button batch-pulls the
--   same rows client-side, but fails under load. These queries are the
--   server-side equivalent, plus pre-aggregated rollups for the retention
--   pattern analysis.
--
-- HOW TO READ THE DATA (critical — see src/services/error-reporter.service.ts)
--   audit_log is a CURATED sink, not a raw firehose. Client errors pass through
--   suppression -> dedup (60s) -> rate-limit (10/min/tab, scaled to as low as
--   10% under load) -> escalate-after-N -> severity downgrade before they land.
--   So raw counts are a FLOOR, not the true rate. The aggregate meta-events in
--   query (B2) are the real error-volume signal. The highest-risk failures
--   (auth-token lock contention, stale-bundle, DB overload) are suppressed or
--   downgraded OUT of audit_log entirely — cover those via ops_events and
--   login_attempts in section C.
--
-- COLUMN NOTES (verified against supabase/migrations)
--   audit_log         -> created_at   (purged at 90 days by audit-log-daily-purge)
--   ops_events        -> occurred_at  (purged at 90 days)
--   login_attempts    -> created_at
--   failed_login_attempts -> attempted_at   (NOT created_at)
--   changed_fields is text[]; metadata is packed as 'key:value' strings,
--   e.g. 'source:edge.process-email-queue', 'severity:error', 'trace:<id>',
--   'field:<name>', 'schema:<name>'.
--
-- CAVEATS
--   * "Since the first log" is effectively a rolling ~90-day window (purge cron).
--   * Client-error history before ~May 2026 is unreliable: a nil-UUID bug
--     silently dropped every authenticated client_error until it was fixed.
--   * Confirm whether history was carried from the old Lovable project; the
--     migration primarily copied auth.users / profiles / storage.

-- SECTION A — RAW EXPORT (mirrors the in-app Download CSV button)
-- =============================================================================

-- A1. Full raw activity log. No LIMIT — returns everything, newest first.
--     Contains PII (user_id, actor_email). Use the no-PII rollups in B/C if you
--     would rather not ship identifiers.

--     error storms the log otherwise refuses to record. Most important chart.
--     ADR-0031: `client_error_suppressed` now ALSO carries structural-classifier
--     drops — a persistently-broken backend seen as "transient" spikes HERE
--     instead of vanishing. To attribute the sub-type, drill into the
