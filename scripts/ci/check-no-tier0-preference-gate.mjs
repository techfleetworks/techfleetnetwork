// CI guard (BLOCKING): no critical (Tier 0) email sender may gate on a member preference.
//
// Tier 0 = critical transactional email (interview invites, applicant status, observer grants,
// the agreement offer, resume reminder, ...). These must ALWAYS send; only global suppression can
// stop them. The core bug this whole rearchitecture fixes was gating them on `notify_announcements`
// (default false), silently dropping critical mail for ~87% of users. This guard prevents that
// class of regression: it fails if an edge function reads `notify_announcements` /
// `notify_training_opportunities` in code, unless it is on the allowlist of senders that
// legitimately still gate a non-Tier-0 email (removed as each is migrated).
//
// Allowlist (shrinks over the rollout):
//   (empty) - every Tier-1 sender now selects recipients by notify_opportunities.
//   History: send-announcement-email and quest-nudge were both moved off notify_announcements to
//   notify_opportunities in PR 5, so neither is allowlisted any longer. The announcement composer
//   still gets a "this is not marketing" attestation in PR 7 to keep marketing in Email Octopus,
//   but that is a content-governance gate, not a recipient-preference gate, so it is out of scope
//   for this check.
//
// Scope: supabase/functions/<name>/*.ts, excluding _shared (the tier registry documents these
// column names in comments/notes and is not a sender).
