 * AUTH-ARCH-CUTOVER-015 — lock the deletion of `src/services/auth.service.ts`.
 *
 * The legacy 625-line mixed-responsibility auth service was deleted on
 * 2026-06-15. Re-introducing it (or any file at that exact path) re-opens
 * every spaghetti bug class the cutover closed. CI fails immediately so
 * the file cannot be revived through a stray `git add`.
