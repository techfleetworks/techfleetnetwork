/**
 * AUTH-ARCH-CUTOVER-022 — auth screens must talk only to their engine.
 *
 * Screens in `src/features/auth/ui/*.tsx` are presentation-only. They MUST NOT
 * import:
 *   - the backend client (`@/integrations/supabase/client`)
 *   - the session port (`@/features/auth/ports/*`)
 *   - the per-use-case services (`@/features/auth/services/*`)
 *   - the flows (`@/features/auth/flows/*`)
 *   - the rate-limit/captcha/lockout libraries directly
 *
 * The single allowed dependency direction is screen → engine → flow → service
 * → adapter. Anything else re-opens the spaghetti the cutover removed.
