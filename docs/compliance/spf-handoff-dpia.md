# DPIA — Hand-Off Production System (AI processing of personal data)

Status: Phase 0 governance artifact. A Data Protection Impact Assessment is **required** here
because the feature is high-risk processing under the privacy skill's trigger: _large-scale
processing of personal data by new technology (a multi-agent LLM pipeline)_. Companion to
`spf-handoff-data-classification.md` and `docs/compliance/privacy-runbook.md`.

## 1. Processing described

Active project teammates upload deliverables (files + ≤10k text) that can contain personal
data — teammate names, client/constituent names, stakeholder feedback, meeting-recording
links. A multi-agent LLM pipeline — served via **OpenRouter**, using **Anthropic Claude Opus 4.8**
for the audience writers and **DeepSeek v4** for fact extraction and source mapping — parses this,
extracts a fact base, and writes four
audience narrative documents, stored in private Storage and readable in-app by active members
of that project. **No automated distribution in this build** (email deferred).

- **Data subjects:** Tech Fleet teammates on the project; named clients/constituents and
  stakeholders appearing in uploaded materials (third parties who did not sign up).
- **Personal data categories:** names, roles, professional opinions/feedback, work product
  attributable to individuals. No special-category data is _required_; free-text uploads could
  contain it incidentally (mitigation below).
- **New technology:** LLM multi-agent generation → the DPIA trigger.

## 2. Necessity & proportionality

- **Lawful basis:** legitimate interest — a team producing a hand-off of _its own_ project work
  for onboarding/case-study/leadership purposes. Purpose is limited to that; the data is not
  repurposed.
- **Minimization:** the thin-projection of SPF workshops/deliverables; ≤10k text cap per
  component; only active-project members can read outputs. (Org Case Study pseudonymization —
  roles rather than names where identity isn't needed — is planned, not yet implemented.)
- **Third-party data:** client/stakeholder personal data enters via teammate uploads. Mitigation:
  purpose limitation, access restricted to the project team, retention window, and the ability
  to delete on request.

## 4. Data-subject rights

Access/export and erasure are **specified** in `spf-handoff-data-classification.md` (they must
traverse every Restricted store) but are **not yet engineered for the hand-off stores** — a tracked
gap to close in Phase B3 before real personal data flows. Consent/withdrawal handling and
audit entries for DSAR receipt + fulfilment are required (see the `@compliance` scenarios in
the plan).

## 5. Residual risk & decision

With the mitigations above — and with **auto-distribution deferred** (removing the LLM06/LLM08
auto-send risk for this build) — residual risk is assessed **acceptable for launch of the
in-app (produce → store → view) MVP**. Re-assess this DPIA before building the distribution
phase (email fanout + any review/release gate), which reintroduces the high-impact auto-send
risk. Owner sign-off required before Phase B3 ships to production.
