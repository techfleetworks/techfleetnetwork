# Data Classification, Inventory & Retention — SPF Data Layer + Hand-Off System

Status: Phase 0 governance artifact for the Hand-Off Production System + SPF data-layer work.
Companion to `docs/compliance/privacy-runbook.md` and the DPIA
(`spf-handoff-dpia.md`). Classification scheme: **Public / Internal / Confidential /
Restricted** (Restricted = personal or otherwise sensitive data — strongest controls).

## Why this exists

Per the compliance-data-lifecycle skill: "Know what data you hold, why you're allowed to hold
it, how long you keep it, who can touch it, how you'd prove that to an auditor, and how you'd
get it back if it's lost." This inventory is what makes deletion, export, and audit
_executable_ — every store below is a place a DSAR deletion/export must reach.

## Retention & deletion

- **Retention window** (locked decision): version history keeps latest + archives older with a
  bounded window that caps growth; expiry is **automated** (soft-delete → scheduled hard-delete)
  with its own audit-log entry. Deletion jobs are idempotent, resumable, dry-run-against-counts
  first, and take a verified backup before large purges.
- **DSAR deletion must PROPAGATE** to every Restricted store above (2, 3, 4, 5, 8) plus caches;
  a delete that only removes the primary row is a compliance failure. Backups follow the
  documented "time-boxed retention + deleted data is not restored to prod" policy rather than
  surgical backup edits.
- **DSAR export** must gather all personal data across derived stores (2–6, 8), not just the
  primary rows.

## Vendors / subprocessors

- **Groq** is a **new subprocessor** for Restricted data (prompts contain personal data) →
  requires a DPA + entry in the subprocessor register + a data-residency/cross-border
  assessment (where Groq processes). Flagged for owner action.
- **Supabase Storage** (existing) holds Restricted blobs → same-classification controls
  (private buckets, encryption at rest, signed-URL scoping).

## Data minimization (privacy by design)

The **workshops/deliverables thin-projection** (Locked decision 10) is the concrete
minimization control: the generation context receives only the ~6 fields it needs, not the
~29-field workshop record. Every field entering the LLM context is justified against a
generation need. The Org Case Study / analytics-facing version pseudonymizes where identity
isn't required.
