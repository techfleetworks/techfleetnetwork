# Architecture Decision Records

Lightweight ADRs for significant, long-lived decisions (new bounded contexts, data-source
changes, contracts other code depends on). Format: **Status / Context / Decision /
Alternatives considered / Consequences**. Immutable — a superseded decision is
marked `Superseded by ADR-XXXX`, never deleted or rewritten.

## Naming new ADRs — use a date prefix, never a new sequential number

A new ADR's filename is `<YYYYMMDD>-<slug>.md` (the day you write it), and its header is
`# ADR <YYYYMMDD> — <title>`. **Do not mint a new 4-digit number.** The sequential space
(`0001`…) is **frozen**: a shared counter allocated at author time cannot be made
collision-free, so parallel branches each grabbed "the next number" and collided on merge —
over and over (0009/0013/0014/0016 on `main`, the 0015→0018 renumber noted below, and every
feature branch that sat open while others merged). The date prefix fixes this at the root, the
same way DB migrations already do it (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_...`): two branches almost never share a
day _and_ a slug, so filenames stay unique with zero coordination. `check-adr-number-collision.mjs`
enforces both forms — legacy numbers stay unique (frozen), date ADRs may share a day.

```
# ❌ never — a new sequential number races every other open branch to "the next number"
docs/adr/0071-gumroad-reconcile-clawback.md      →  collides the day another branch also picks 0071

# ✅ always — a date prefix is unique without coordinating with any other branch
docs/adr/20261009-gumroad-reconcile-clawback.md  →  header: "# ADR 20261009 — …"; cite as "ADR 20261009"
```

Legacy numbered ADRs keep their numbers and references (renumbering merged, cross-linked ADRs
would break existing links). Reference a legacy ADR as `ADR-NNNN`, a date ADR as `ADR <YYYYMMDD>`.

The first block of ADRs covers the **Hand-Off Production System + SPF data-layer migration** work
(0008 to 0012 exist in this directory as well). **0015** is the design-system ADR (MUI-owned layer).
ADRs **0013, 0014, 0016, 0017, 0018** cover the **email rearchitecture**; its full skills-vetted
requirements live in `docs/design/email-rearchitecture-requirements.md`. **Revision 2 (2026-08-20):**
Email Octopus became the marketing source of truth, so 0013 and 0014 are superseded by 0017. (The
scope-separation ADR was renumbered 0015 → 0018 to resolve a collision with the design-system ADR.)
