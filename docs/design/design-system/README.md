# TechFleet Design System (TFDS) — built on MUI Core

> Status: **Proposed** (see [ADR 0015](../../adr/0015-mui-owned-design-system-layer.md)). This folder
> is the spec + audit for migrating the app's UI from shadcn/ui to an **owned design-system layer
> on Material UI Community (MUI Core, MIT)**. Nothing here is built yet — these are the plans we
> execute against.

## What this is (and isn't)

- **Is:** one library (**MUI Core**, free/MIT), themed once to look like Tech Fleet today, consumed
  through a single owned layer at `src/design-system/` (import alias `@/design-system`). We own the
  API, the theme, and any custom components — in our repo, documented here.
- **Isn't:** a fork of MUI's source repo, and not MUI X (the paid Pro/Premium tier). AG Grid stays for
  tables; recharts stays for charts. See ADR 0015 for why a literal fork was rejected.

## Shared vocabulary — Atomic Design

We organize and talk about every UI piece using Brad Frost's **Atomic Design** five levels. Use these
words when we discuss changes so we mean the same thing:

| Level         | Definition                                                                        | In this app                                                 | Examples                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atoms**     | Smallest UI elements; can't be broken down and still be useful.                   | Themed MUI primitives.                                      | Button, Input, Label, Badge, Icon, **Typography**, Checkbox, Switch, Skeleton, Spinner.                                 |
| **Molecules** | A few atoms bonded into a small reusable unit with one job.                       | Owned wrappers/composites.                                  | Form Field (label + input + error), Multi-Select, Tabs, Breadcrumb, Alert, Save-Status, Pagination, Tooltip.            |
| **Organisms** | Larger sections composed of molecules + atoms; a distinct region of an interface. | Owned composites + delegated libs.                          | Dialog, Sheet/Drawer, Sidebar, Nav Menu, Command Palette, Toaster, **Data Grid (AG Grid)**, **Chart (recharts)**, Card. |
| **Templates** | Page-level layout skeletons; arrange organisms, no real content.                  | App shells / route layouts (`src/layouts`, page scaffolds). | AppShell, DashboardLayout, AuthLayout, SettingsLayout.                                                                  |
| **Pages**     | A template filled with real content/state; an actual route.                       | `src/pages/**`, `src/features/**`.                          | ProjectFormPage, ResourcesPage, Admin dashboards.                                                                       |

**The dependency rule:** higher levels compose lower levels, never the reverse. Pages use templates;
templates use organisms; organisms use molecules; molecules use atoms; atoms use the **theme + tokens**.
Nothing imports MUI directly except the atoms/molecules inside `src/design-system/` (enforced by an
ESLint rule — see the architecture spec).

## Documentation is part of the build

Every component we **build, wrap, or change** ships with its docs in the same PR — a change isn't done until
it's documented. Per-component docs live in `components/<layer>/<Name>.md` (API, deviation from stock MUI,
what it replaces, usage). See the [architecture spec §7a](architecture-spec.md) for the exact requirement.
This README's **Build log** below is the running record of what was done.

## Design tokens — the single source of truth

Color, spacing, radius, motion, and font tokens live as CSS variables in
[`src/index.css`](../../../src/index.css) and are surfaced through
[`tailwind.config.ts`](../../../tailwind.config.ts) today. The MUI theme **references those same CSS
variables** (e.g. `palette.primary.main = 'hsl(var(--primary))'`) rather than duplicating values, so
`index.css` stays the one place tokens are defined and light/dark keeps working through the `.dark`
class. The canonical brand reference is [`docs/brand/brand-identity-guide.md`](../../brand/brand-identity-guide.md).
