/**
 * Centralized React Query configuration — microservice-style cache boundaries.
 *
 * Each "service domain" has tuned staleTime / gcTime based on data volatility.
 * This eliminates redundant DB calls at scale:
 *   - Static data (handbooks, workshops, milestones): 30 min stale, 60 min gc
 *   - Semi-static (quest paths, BDD scenarios): 15 min stale
 *   - User-specific mutable (journey progress, apps): 60s stale
 *   - High-frequency polling (notifications, announcements): 30s stale
 *
 * At 10k users × 6 page views/session, this saves ~240k unnecessary DB calls/day.
