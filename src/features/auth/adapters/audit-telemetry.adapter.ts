/**
 * AUTH-ENGINE Ship 6 — audit telemetry adapter.
 *
 * Single fire-and-forget seam between auth engines and ops_events. Engines
 * call `recordAuthEngineEvent(kind, payload)`; this adapter posts to the
 * `record-auth-event` edge function which validates the kind allowlist and
 * writes via `record_event(sink='ops_events', severity='info')`.
 *
 * Failures never throw — telemetry must never block sign-in.
