/**
 * Session port — AUTH-ARCH-CUTOVER-014 (2026-06-15).
 *
 * Single seam between non-auth-screen callers (AuthContext bootstrap,
 * ProfileEditPanel, EditProfilePage, …) and the per-use-case auth services.
 * Zero dependency on the deleted legacy `@/services/auth.service`.
 *
 * RULES
 * - Non-auth-screen code outside `src/features/auth/**` MUST import session
 *   methods from this file (enforced by `no-restricted-imports`).
 * - This file is the ONLY non-engine module allowed to wire the per-use-case
 *   auth services into a flat callable surface for legacy code.
 * - New code SHOULD import the specific use-case service directly rather than
 *   widening this port further.
