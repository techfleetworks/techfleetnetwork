        content: `**Overview**

Project training, otherwise known as apprenticeship training, is the chance for people to apply what they've learned in their education to a real team with real problem-solving and real clients. Our community offers this because we believe in the practice that counts toward experience building. We believe that teammates cannot do it alone, they must do it together across functions, and they need to decide together. Our roots of this community were started by people joining cross-functional teams to progress in work. At the same time, we've focused a lot of efforts on building training that coaches agile culture on teams. Now, as of 2025, all of our apprenticeship teammates are just "teammates" working together toward a common set of outcomes they agree to themselves. This is their training. People in our community level up and grow professionally through practice and decision making together. The project training we offer is the way they do this.

**Types of Clients**

All of our clients are existing nonprofit organizations with a 501(c)(3) or other nonprofit status. We partner with mission-driven organizations who are motivated to give back to our mission by being a client.

They support our mission by providing a forum for cross-functional teams to build experience together. Together, project trainees and clients work towards solving problems and delivering change in the world.

When we get together with clients, we go through a process of determining who they are, what their mission is, what they're trying to do, and why. We document this in a client intake and provide this on our project dashboard so that everyone in the community can see the goals and outcomes that the nonprofit is trying to achieve.

We encourage clients NOT to require an NDA or confidentiality agreement when working with us, and this is part of our terms of working with the community. We do this because we want our trainees to be able to produce story-driven case studies about their work so that they can showcase their growth.

**Types of Projects**

Our project training teams learn how to solve problems together through service design, strategy, web-based products, and discovery projects.`,

The world requires experience, a portfolio, and a lot of skills. In our community, you can be a teammate and share leadership with others, with none of that.

While some teammates carry experience, you do not need any prior experience to take a team role in Tech Fleet project training. Teammates are chosen based on their level of service leadership mindset and their level of agile mindset. You can build this as a community member through our Agile training and resources.

        content: `**Team Structure**

Project structure is set up as a cross-functional structure.

Agile and empowered teams are all about sharing leadership and sharing decision making together.

Teammates share leadership with each other, and everyone makes decisions together in the ways of self-organization.

No one team member is "above" another lead or co-lead. Everyone pitches in to the work they want to commit to each week in sprint planning sessions through RACI Charts and Sprint Goals activities.

Teammates choose to perform different duties and responsibilities every time they prioritize work as a team.

**Teammate Responsibilities**

Each teammate is able to float across responsibilities as part of a cross-functional team. Each team position has daily expectations for responsibilities under each role they play.

1. Project management function
• Account management duties
• Project management duties
• Scrum master duties
• Product operations duties

2. Product strategy function
• Business analysis duties
• Product ownership duties
• Product management duties
• UX research duties

3. UX research function
• UX research duties
• UX strategy duties

4. UX design function
• UX design duties
• UX research duties
• UX strategy duties

5. UX writing function
• UX writing duties
• UX research duties
• UX strategy duties

6. Development function
• Front-end development duties
• Back-end development duties
• Solutions architecture duties
• QA duties

        content: `**Basics**

Tech Fleet has a long standing history of community-driven changes in its own process. From 2020 to 2025, we had a process where people fill out a single Google Forms survey every time they apply. Whenever they applied to multiple projects, they'd need to answer the same questions redundantly. This wasted a lot of time for members who were trying to get into teams.

As of February 2025, Tech Fleet has enacted a new set of applications that helps project coordinators and community members alike. These will save people time and ensure that project teams review useful information before picking team mates for project training.

Tech Fleet members now fill out two applications: the General Application they fill out once, and the Project Phase Application they fill out any time they want to join a training team. The information from the General Application is pulled into the Project Phase Application, saving members time and energy. They no longer have to answer every single question every single time.

**The General Application**

The General Application is designed to capture important information about yourself and your training desires only once. Members can fill it out once and update their answers over time. This saves time when people are applying to projects since they don't need to answer a lot of the questions again and again (as they did before).

The General Application has questions about:

1. Your time zone and availability
2. Your education outside of Tech Fleet
3. Your prior engagement and training within Tech Fleet
4. Your desired skill sets to focus on
5. Your Servant Leadership mindset
6. Your Agile mindset

**The Project Phase Application**

You fill out the Project Phase Application every time you apply to a project training phases in Tech Fleet. The information from the General Application is pulled into the Project Phase Application, saving members time and energy. They no longer have to answer every single question every single time.

The Project Phase application has questions about:

1. Have you completed your Tech Fleet General Application?
2. Information about your desired project position
3. Questions related to projects

**The Process for Projects**

Tech Fleet continually iterates on its project management lifecycle to improve the success for all who are involved.

As of this moment, the process for projects is broken into chunks:

1. 4 weeks applications and team building
2. 2 weeks of pre-kickoff work with the team
3. 8 weeks of project work during the phase
4. 1 week of hand-off work after the phase

**How the Applications are Used**

The Project Coordinator Guild and the co-leads who are picked on teams review these answers when you apply to projects before picking team mates.

We know what you're thinking: "I'm not good enough to answer these questions". Have no fear! This is not true. We take people of all background and skill levels on Tech Fleet projects. After all, that's why Tech Fleet is here: to help you grow for a great tech career!

We do not use this data to disqualify anyone, but we do use it to see where you are in your journey to the tech field and in the Tech Fleet community.

**Tech Fleet's Privacy Policy for Application Information**

Tech Fleet is committed to keeping our community members and their data secure and private online. We do not share any of your application data with third parties. We use this application data for project training only. We have policies that describe how we use and store the data we collect about our members.`,

**If They Have Never Been on Tech Fleet Projects**

**Tech Fleet Basics:**
• Tech Fleet is an apprenticeship training organization.
• Teams are trained on real Agile methodologies, which are very different from how a lot of schools teach UX and product work, but this is a safe environment to fail and learn.
• The priority on a team is to grow and learn, NOT to produce work. This is not a competitive environment.
• It's an environment to get things wrong and to embrace failure. Team mates need to be given safe spaces to learn.
• When you're on a team, you're in an apprenticeship training. You are not in a job or volunteer position.
• Teams work with nonprofit clients.
• Team members are expected to perform a new way of working as they will be expected in the industry: Agile.

**Agile and Shared Leadership Basics:**
• Agile is a way of building things that provides incremental value instead of value at the end of projects.
• UX work and development happens continuously and at the same time.
• We work in the Scrum method.
• We do "sprints": 2 weeks of work at a time, and deliver small chunks of UX work every 2 weeks.
• Each sprint, the teams deliver research, design, and product work in parallel.
• Each project phase is 4 sprints.
• When one project phase ends, the team documents a handoff and then we open applications for the next project.
• Instead of working alone in a specific title, you will have the opportunity to float across different activities based on what you want to do.
• We have Agile coaches that are training in this community who work with teams to coach Agile and get them going as a Scrum team.

**Teammate Expectations:**
• Teammates share leadership on teams. We are all peers, no one is an expert, no one is the boss. No one provides the answers. Everyone is in service to others' growth.
• There is no hierarchy on the team. Teammates are equals to each other.
• Every sprint, everyone commits to the work they want to do based on a shared outcome of the team.
• Teammates are all service leaders to each other, and provide psychological safety to each other.

**Suggested Candidate Questions:**

• How would you explain service leadership in your own words?
• Service leaders transfer the power to their teammates. How will you do this on your team?
• How do you live as a service leader to your peers?
• How would you contribute to coaching your team in the Agile philosophies?
• Some teams find themselves in situations where teammates wait to be told what to do. Some people tell others what to do. This is the opposite of the dynamic we want. We want collective decision making as a unified team. What does this mean to you? How would you accomplish this on your team?
• How would you handle a situation where a team mate is not being a service leader to you or to someone else?
• How would you handle situations of uncertainty, or situations where the client is not providing direction you need as a team?
• Do you have any questions for me?`,

        content: `**Application Tips**

1. **Be Vigilant** — Look out for information on upcoming Tech Fleet projects by checking the #project-openings channel and the Tech Fleet Newsletter.

2. **Follow & Contribute** — At Tech Fleet we believe that contribution = growth. Those who contribute should be awarded more opportunities to contribute further. Being a project observer is a great way of understanding the working dynamics of a Tech Fleet team and making a contribution to the community.

3. **Prepare for Agile and Service Leadership** — All Agile team mates are expert collaborators before anything else. People on Tech Fleet projects often must build a mindset of Agile and of Servant Leadership before they can fully succeed in teams and contribute their best work. Take the Servant Leadership Masterclass and read the Agile handbook before applying to maximize your success.

4. **Shadow shadow shadow!** — Observers gain advantage in Tech Fleet programs because they've seen the work happen on teams. We recommend you shadow for one full week, watching as many team meetings on one project that you can, so you get a full sense of the work ahead. Show in your application responses that you've shadowed, and your leads will be able to tell you've prepared for the apprenticeship program.

5. **Apply apply apply!** — When project applications open up, they are for anyone wanting to apply. We don't ask for a resumé or a portfolio. What we are most interested in is your willingness to learn and help others do the same. This sentiment should be reflected in your application.

6. **Write with quality over quantity** — Check out the application questions to see how to prepare. When you write your application responses, be sure to write detailed and concise answers with as much context as you can build. When leads look at your responses they only have these to go off, and your history in Tech Fleet, to decide whether you're a good fit to interview. So don't be afraid to show your passion, show your chops, show your gumption in these responses.`,
