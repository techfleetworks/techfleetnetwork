/**
 * Regression guard for Fleety's ANSWER model (the Groq "brain" that writes
 * replies — distinct from the Gemini embedding model guarded in
 * fleety-embed-provider.smoke.test.ts).
 *
 * `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` is being deprecated by Groq (scheduled shutoff
 * 2026-08-16). Left in place it would fail exactly like the retired embedding
 * model did — a silent HTTP error, then ungrounded/broken answers. PR6 moved
 * every call site (router, main generation, cost accounting, log) onto a single
 * `GROQ_MODEL` constant set to the current production model. These assertions
 * read the source directly (Deno-only edge fn, can't be imported into vitest)
 * and fail loudly if a deprecated model or a hard-coded model string creeps
 * back in.
