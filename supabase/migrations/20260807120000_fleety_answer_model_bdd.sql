-- BDD for the Groq ANSWER-model migration (llama-3.3-70b-versatile deprecating
-- 2026-08-16 -> would fail like the retired embedding model). PR6 moves every
-- call site onto a single GROQ_MODEL constant (openai/gpt-oss-120b) with
-- reasoning_effort pinned low to protect the streaming latency SLO.
-- Executable coverage: src/test/smoke/fleety-answer-model.smoke.test.ts (vitest, CI).
