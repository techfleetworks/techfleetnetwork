// Shared, SSRF-guarded fetch of member-supplied material links. Single source of truth for the
// allow-list so the two surfaces that fetch member content — fleety-review (the coach endpoint)
// and techfleet-chat (in-chat "review my link") — can never drift apart.
//
// SECURITY (OWASP SSRF + DoS cheat sheets): https only; host must be on the allow-list (Figma or
// Tech Fleet's own domains); IP-literal + credentialed URLs rejected; caller MUST fetch with
// redirect:"error"; response is size- and time-bounded. The fetched bytes are UNTRUSTED DATA —
// callers frame them as data (never instructions) when they reach an LLM (prompt-injection defense).

// Reuse the ONE hardened Figma engine (the hand-off generator's): node-scoped fetch that pulls only
// the linked frame's subtree (so a 100k-node board never blows up), a streamed byte cap that can't
// OOM the worker, and 429/5xx retry. This is why Fleety can now read large boards the same way
// hand-off does — earlier it fetched the WHOLE file and choked on "too large".
