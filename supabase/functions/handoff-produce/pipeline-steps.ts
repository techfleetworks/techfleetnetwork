// Resumable step machine for the hand-off pipeline (Phase B2, durable async).
//
// WHY: a full run is extraction (per component) + writing (per audience x story arc) + finalize
// (render + store per audience) — far more work than one edge invocation can safely hold. If the
// invocation is recycled mid-run, the work must RESUME, not restart. So the pipeline is modelled as
// an ordered list of small UNITS with a persisted cursor + accumulated state (fact base, written
// prose). A worker advances the cursor one unit at a time, CHECKPOINTS after each, and can stop at
// any point (budget hit, lease lost); the next worker tick reloads the state and continues from the
// cursor. This module is PURE: the side effects (LLM calls, storage writes) are injected, so the
// resume/stop/ordering logic is unit-tested with fakes — no DB, no network.
